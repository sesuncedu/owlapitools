/**
 * This class allows for the extraction of subsets of axioms based on their
 * types; the purpose is to offer a flexible extraction mechanism to collect
 * axioms belonging to, e.g., the ABox, the TBox or the RBox of an ontology.
 * Sets of axiom types covering these cases are available in
 * AxiomType::TBoxAxiomTypes, AxiomType::ABoxAxiomTypes,
 * AxiomType::RBoxAxiomType, but the class can be configured through the
 * constructor arguments to include different subsets. The idea for this
 * construct was graciously provided by Thomas Scharrenbach, Swiss Federal
 * Research Institute WSL
 * (http://www.wsl.ch/info/mitarbeitende/scharren/owl-defaults/index_EN?redir=1)
 * This class does not store any internal state referring to the ontology; it is
 * safe for use in multithread environments, provided that the parameters to the
 * constructor do not change while the constructor executes and the OWLOntology
 * implementation is itself threadsafe. A single instance can be reused for
 * extracting the same Box from different ontologies without side effects.
